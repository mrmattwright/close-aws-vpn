Before blindly installing this, do check what it's doing so you know it's legit and not mining bitcoin or something.

Have a look in the `manifest.json` file and you'll see that it's only asking for permission to control tabs. Have a look in the `background.js` file and you'll see that it's only closing tabs that have a URLs that match `http://127.0.0.1:35001/"`. If you're not happy with that, don't install it.
